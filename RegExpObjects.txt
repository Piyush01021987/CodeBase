Explain RegExp Object in QTP
RegExp is a very important object in QTP that can be used to find the patterns in given string using regular expressions.

This object can be created using below syntax.
Set regExpObject = New RegExp  

RegExp Object supports below properties.

Global Property     - a pattern should match all occurrences in string or just the first one
IgnoreCase Property - specifies if the search is case-sensitive or not
Pattern Property    - Sequence of literal characters and special characters (Meta Characters like *,?,+,\b,\d,\n etc)

RegExp Object supports below methods.

Test Method     - returns true if the pattern is found in the given string
Execute Method  - returns a Matches collection containing a Match object(having properties firstindex and value) for each match found in string.
Replace Method  - replaces the matched values in the given string by another value


Sample Example on Execute method.

'*******************************************************
 Set regExpObject = New RegExp  
  search_string = "My Name is piyush chandana and my father's name is Mr. Vishan Kumar Chandana."
  regExpObject.Pattern = "chandana"

  regExpObject.Ignorecase = true
  regExpObject.Global = true
 
 Set matches  = regExpObject.execute(search_string)

 For each match in matches
	print  match.firstIndex & " - " & match.value
 Next

In above example we are trying to find the pattern "lucky" in the given string "MS dhoni is very lucky cricketer". 
We are also printing the position where the match is found.
